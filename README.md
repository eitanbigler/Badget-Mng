Hi! 
My name is Eitan and I am a student at the Technion's DevOps Professional Course.
This is schoolwork!

The system will add a log of incomes and expenses.

Data source format:

Example:
budget_data = {
"balance": 500,
"transactions": [
{"type": "income", "amount": 1000, "description": "Salary"},
{"type": "expense", "amount": 500, "description": "Groceries"}
]
}

Modules:
1. Add Income
2. Add Expense
3. Show Balance
4. Show Transaction History
5. Exit
